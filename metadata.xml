[h1]Chiron[/h1]
+0.2 Speed up. Entering a new floor will give a random mapping effect. Entering a boss room will trigger a random book effect.

[h1]Juno[/h1]
+1 Soul Heart. Tears that hit an enemy have a chance to chain down the nearest enemy for 5 seconds, preventing them from moving.

Tears bounce off the floor after floating for a short time, cause splash damage on every bounce, and increases tear size by 20%.

[h1]Ceres[/h1]
